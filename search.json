At the SMLB we aim to focus on the theory of Machine Learning methods that are advancing biological and biotechnological research. It was created to share knowledge, resources and research in an engaging way, and to bring curious scientists together. We run weekly sessions in one of the following forms: workshops, study sessions, Journal Club-style sessions and research talks. A record of all sessions is kept at the official SMLB Notion site.\nDates 04/2025 - Present\nLinks: SMLB site\n\n\nInformation-theoretical tools for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis\nElucidating structure from single-cell RNA-seq data is a major challenge in modern biological research. For my final project of the MRes in Bioinformatics and Theoretical Systems Biology, I improved existing and developed novel information-theoretical tools to uncover real relationships between genes as part of the single-cell RNA-seq data analysis pipeline. This work introduced theoretically tractable alternatives to available methods. Further developments from the Theoretical Systems Biology group and part of my work are now being prepared for publication.\nCollaborators: Theoretical Systems Biology group, Briscoe Lab\n\n\nPredicting DNA function when grafted across species\nFor one of my rotations in the PhD programme, I was part of a larger genome engineering project led by the Parts Lab focused on inter-species chromosome transplantation. I developed an approach that involved fine-tuning DNA language models to elucidate the extent to which the effects of chromosome grafting could be learned. I summarised my findings in a poster which earned the Best Poster Award within the PhD cohort.

For this I am leveraging sequence-level information learned from evolution as well as structural information, drawing on methods and expertise from the Marks, Lehner and Sander groups. I am also part of the EVEdesign team, an initiative to democratise AI-driven protein design that enables building complex design pipelines and their integration with experimental data.\nI co-founded and currently lead the Sanger Machine Learning Boocklub, a community of nearly 100 people where we run workshops, study sessions, Journal Club-style sessions and talks on the theory behind AI tools in biological research.\nI previously carried out rotations on fine-tuning DNA language models (supervised by Leo Parts) and using Gaussian Processes for interpretability of DNA foundation models (AI for Cell Engineering Lab, supervised by Mo Lotfollahi). The poster from the former rotation won the Best Poster Award across the PhD cohort.\n\n\nGraduate Researcher (MRes)\nImperial College London & The Francis Crick Institute\n01/2024 - 09/2024\nAs part of the Theoretical Systems Biology group at Imperial College London, and in collaboration with the Briscoe Lab at the Crick, I improved existing and developed novel information-theoretical tools for single-cell RNAseq data analysis. Part of this work is being prepared for publication. Prior to that, I worked on a project aiming to benchmark deep learning methods for Bayesian Inference to parametrise models of gene regulatory networks. Both projects achieved a Distinction within the MRes in Bioinformatics and Theoretical Systems Biology at Imperial College.\n\n\nUndergraduate Researcher (BSc)\nUCL\n01/2023 - 05/2023\nDuring my final undergraduate year I carried out a Metagenomics Research Project investigating the effect of the microbiome composition on neurodegenerative disease incidence and progression, and trained diagnostic Machine Learning models for disease prediction. I also completed a Literature Project on network biology for Alzheimer’s Disease biomarker discovery, supervised by Prof Christine Orengo. Both projects achieved a High First within the BSc in Biochemistry.\n\n\nIndustrial Placement Student in Biophysics\nUCL and Nxera Pharma\n09/2021 - 08/2022\nI gained significant wet and dry lab experience specialised on Cryo-EM whilst working within the Biophysics department in the Biomolecular Structure Team. In collaboration with the rest of the team, we solved the first-ever structures of a challenging drug target. I improved my teamwork and presentation skills, and my project was awarded an Exceptionally High First."
