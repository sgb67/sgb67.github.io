## Bio

I am a computational biologist and biochemist passionate about building statistical and machine learning solutions to advance biotechnology. My work focuses on developing novel computational approaches for functional protein engineering, with a particular emphasis on AI-driven enzyme design. I am currently pursuing a PhD at the University of Cambridge and the Wellcome Sanger Institute, working closely with Harvard Medical School under the supervision of Debbie Marks. The intersection of biology, computation, and design drives my research and fuels my commitment to innovate within the life sciences.

This site showcases my professional profile, past and projects, and research endeavors. It serves as a hub for sharing my work and connecting with the broader scientific community.

If you are interested in my work, or want to contact me for any other reason, do not hesitate to reach out to me via LinkedIn or email.
